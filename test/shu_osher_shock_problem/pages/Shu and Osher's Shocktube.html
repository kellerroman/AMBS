<p>
Shu, C and Osher, S., "Efficient Implementation of Essentially
Non-Oscillatory Shock-Capturing Schemes, II", J. Computational Physics,
83, 32-78 (1989).  The test is Example 8.

<h2>Description:</h2>
</dl>
<p>
This test is a hydrodynamic shocktube where the left and the right states
are given as follows.  Left: (ρ=3.857143; Vx= 2.629369, P = 10.33333)
Right: (ρ=1 + 0.2 sin(5 π x); Vx=0; P=1).  Essentially it is a Mach=3
shock interacting with a sine wave in density.

<h2>What's important about this test?</h2>
</dl>
<p>
This test shows the difficulty of capturing both small-scale smooth flow, and
shocks.

<h2>Results:</h2>
</dl>

<p>
Results for the density at time=0.47 computed with Athena using the
third-order Roe
 solver on an array of 800 cells (solid line) and 200
cells (squares)
 with a Courant number of 0.8 and γ = 1.4. Note that
the plot is
 normalized to a spatial extent of [-1,1] as opposed to the
[-4,4]
 shown in the reference.  By comparing to Fig. 14c in the text,
it
 is possible to see the significant improvement in performance per

 zone at low resolution.  At a resolution of 200 cells, all of the

short-wavelength extrema are captured, albeit with a lower amplitude

than the 800 cell calculation. The velocity and pressure profiles do

not contain as much interesting structure and are not shown.
